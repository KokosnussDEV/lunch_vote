feature: differentiate between vote administrators and vote participants

implementation:
1. add functions to client-side js:
  1. base62_encode from app.js
  2. String.prototype.hashCode from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7616461/generate-a-hash-from-string-in-javascript-jquery
2. in client, check for the presence of a URL fragment #
  1. if present, check if its contents are equal to the following:
    base62_encode(view_model.group_id.hashCode())
  2. if present and correct, treat the user as an admin, and allow access to the 'start vote' and 'vote times' sections
  3. else hide those sections
3. in server, when redirecting the creator of a new vote page, include the admin code
4. in client, if current user is admin, when clicking the share link, show a popup window with two buttons:
  * share (admin)
  * share (public)
5. in client if current user is not admin, behave as before (send public link, immediate)
